# TeamTreeHouse-Project-1
Build a Soccer League

Goals:

1. In your Python program, read the data from the supplied CSV file. Store that data in an appropriate data type so that it can be used in the next task.

2. Create logic that can iterate through all 18 players and assign them to teams such that each team has the same number of players. The number of experienced players on each team should also be the same.

3. Finally, the program should output a text file named -- teams.txt -- that contains the league roster listing the team name, and each player on the team including the player's information: name, whether they've played soccer before and their guardians' names.

Before you start:

1. Have a GitHub account and know how to create a new repository and upload files to it. As with the previous projects, you'll submit your finished working using GitHub.
2. If you need a reminder on how to use GitHub and GitHub desktop to create a new repository check out the workshop 'Share Your Projects wIth GitHub Desktop' in the Project Resources, or the GitHub in Workspaces Workshop.
3. Download the supplied CSV file -- soccer_players.csv by clicking the Project Files link on this page. This file contains the players' information.
4. Read the instructions carefully - we suggest twice, at least.
5. Download the player data spreadsheet.
6. You’ll certainly need your computer to complete the project, but you may want to begin by sketching out your ideas/code with a pencil and paper.

Other Goals:

Done - 1. Create a script named league_builder.py.
2. Make sure the script doesn't execute when imported; put all of your logic and function calls inside of an if __name__ == "__main__": block.
3. Create variables and programming logic to divide the 18 players into three teams: Sharks, Dragons and Raptors. Make sure the teams have the same number of players on them, and that the experience players are divided equally across the three teams.
4. Create a text file named teams.txt that includes the name of a team, followed by the players on that team. List all three teams and their players.
5. In the list of teams, include the team name on one line, followed by a separate line for each player. Include the player's name, whether the player has experience playing soccer, and the player's guardian names. Separate each bit of player information by a comma. For example, the text file might start something like this:
  Sharks
  Frank Jones, YES, Jim and Jan Jones
  Sarah Palmer, YES, Robin and Sari Washington
  Joe Smith, NO, Bob and Jamie Smith
6. Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!

Extra Credit Goals:

1. Create 18 text files ("welcome" letters to the players' guardians). You'll create 1 text file for each player. Use the player’s name as the name of the file, in lowercase and with underscores and ending in .txt. For example, kenneth_love.txt.

2. Make sure that each file begins with the text "Dear" followed by the guardian(s) name(s). Also include the additional required information: player's name, team name, and date & time of first practice.
